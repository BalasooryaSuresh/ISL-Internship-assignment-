Project Description
The ISL Internship Assignment focuses on the development of a drone frame, which serves as the structural foundation for a drone. This project may include design specifications, simulation files, or code for controlling or testing the drone frame. The specific requirements and deliverables are tailored to the internship tasks assigned by ISL.
Features

Modular drone frame design (if applicable).
Documentation for assembly or simulation.
Codebase for testing or controlling drone frame components (if applicable).
Support for [specific tools or frameworks, e.g., CAD software, Arduino, etc., if known].
