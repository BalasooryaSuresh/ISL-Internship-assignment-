## Project Description
The ISL Internship Assignment focuses on the development of a drone frame, which serves as the structural foundation for a drone. This project may include design specifications, simulation files, or code for controlling or testing the drone frame. The specific requirements and deliverables are tailored to the internship tasks assigned by ISL.

## Features
- Modular drone frame design (if applicable).
- Documentation for assembly or simulation.
- Codebase for testing or controlling drone frame components (if applicable).
- Support for [specific tools or frameworks, e.g., CAD software, Arduino, etc., if known].

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BalasooryaSuresh/ISL-Internship-assignment-.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ISL-Internship-assignment-
   ```
3. Install any required dependencies (modify based on project requirements):
   ```bash
   # Example: pip install -r requirements.txt (for Python-based projects)
   # Example: Install CAD software like Fusion 360 for design files
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the project files in the appropriate software (e.g., CAD software for design files, IDE for code).
2. Follow the documentation in the `docs/` folder (if available) for assembly or simulation instructions.
3. Run the code or simulations as per the provided guidelines:
   ```bash
   # Example: python drone_control.py (for Python-based control scripts)
   ```
